#### Liability for Contents

As the service provider, Lpinventive is responsible for the contents of this website according to Swiss federal laws. However, Swiss law does not obligate service providers to continuously monitor submitted or stored information or to search for evidence that indicates illegal activities.

Legal obligations to remove or block the use of information under Swiss law remain unaffected. Liability in such cases is only possible at the time we become aware of a specific violation of law. Upon becoming aware of any such violations, we will remove the content immediately.

#### Liability for Links

Our website contains links to external third-party websites, over which we have no control. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the linked websites is always responsible for their own content.

The linked websites were reviewed for possible violations of law at the time the links were established. No illegal content was identified at that time. However, ongoing monitoring of the linked websites is not reasonable without specific indications of legal violations. Upon becoming aware of any such violations, we will remove the links immediately.

#### Copyright

The content and works on this website created by Lpinventive are governed by Swiss copyright law. Duplication, processing, distribution, and any form of commercialization of such material beyond the scope of the copyright law require the prior written consent of its respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this website are allowed for private use only, not for commercial use.

We respect third-party copyrights for content on this website that was not created by the provider. Third-party contributions on this site are marked as such. Nevertheless, if you should become aware of a copyright violation, we request that you notify us accordingly. Upon notification of violations, we will remove the relevant content immediately.
